/**
 * The ImportImapFacade is responsible for initializing (and terminating) an IMAP import process on the Tutanota server.
 * The ImportImapFacade is also responsible for initializing the ImportImapFolderSyncState for a single Tutanota folder.
 * The ImportImapFolderSyncState is needed to store relevant IMAP synchronization information for a single folder, most importantly the UID to TutanotaID map.
 * The facade communicates directly with the ImportImapService and the ImportImapFolderService.
